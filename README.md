# Term Travel Game
A simple terminal based game written in Go!

This game is built in order get hands on of the Go language and surely this has helped me get more familiar with Go.

Download the go_term file in the root directory to run this game on Linux/Macos.

This game still has a few bugs which I am not really motivated to fix since I built this only for educational purpose.

Although, contributions are welcome!
